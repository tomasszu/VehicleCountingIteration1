<h1>Vehicle counting 1st Iteration</h1>

<ul>
<li> Counting of Vehicles in vide stream in cv2_counting_main.py.</li>
<li> Testing of counting function in cv2_counting_test.py.</li>
<li> Keys for video access not uploaded</li>

</ul>

<p> Open the python file. Change the "CAM" static variable to your camera number of choice and watch the vehicles be counted both visually and logs output textually in the folder output_logs. Each camera has its own output log file. Each file gets re-written if counting is exited and resumed, so save files for future reference.</p>

<p> Functionality can be tested with the cv2_counting_test.py. Change the "CAM" static variable to your camera number of choice, hold ENTER to progress the video and watch the vehicles be counted both visually and logs output textually in the shared "output.txt".</p>
